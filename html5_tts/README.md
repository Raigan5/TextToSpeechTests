# Evaluation of Web Speech API for Text-to-Speech:

## Software used

[Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) *enables you to incorporate voice data into web apps...*

## Methodology

I utilized a web to input the text that needed to be converted, and the conversion process was provided by the API.

## Initial Results

- **Conversion's speed**: pretty fast\*
- **Cost**: free\*
- **Can it run on my local computer without sending information?**: It sends information to Â¿?\*
- **Parametrizable (gender, dialect, speed,...)**: Take a look at [SpeechSynthesisVoice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechSynthesisVoice)
- **Limits**: the results for short texts were good enough.
