# TextToSpeechTests

## Goal

The goal is to find a suitable software for converting text generated by an AI into speech. What will be evaluated is:
- Conversion's speed
- Cost
- Can it run on my local computer without sending information?
- Parametrizable: gender, dialect, speed,...
- Limits

## Results

- [gtts](./gtts/README.md) is good enough, but I have to do more test.
- [bark](./bark/README.md) was too slow in my local computer.
- [pyttsx3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/text-to-speech-changing-voice-in-python/). I didn't try it yet.
- [HTML5 Text-to-Speech (TTS) APIs](./html5_tts/README)
